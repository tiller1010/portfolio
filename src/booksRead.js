        description="
          My first coding book, JavaScript The Definitive Guide felt
          almost like reading a code dictionary. Useful feature or not,
          this book covers what seems like everything at first. This
          book breaks down the language itself as well as the tools that can be
          used on the client side. This was a satisfying book to finish and really
          opened up my eyes to the scope of the language.

        description="
          React seemed difficult for me to learn at first. I was used to
          keeping HTML and JS seperated, but now I was supposed
          to marry the two in JSX? Learning React made React
          simple to understand and use. The book walks the reader through a
          few projects, teaching concepts by simply adding new features. React
          has become my favorite library and is what I used to build this
          portfolio.

        description="
          JavaScript: The Good Parts was a brief but dense read.
          The book covers all the best and worst practices one
          should use or avoid when using JavaScript. The book is an
          excellent reference for highlighting the way JavaScript works and the
          way it should be used.

        description="
          This book starts out fairly simple, as one would expect.
          Creating blog posts and adding plugins and themes are
          great features of WordPress but not too difficult to
          understand. However, the book becomes more challenging when it
          has the reader developing their own themes and plugins with PHP
          code. WordPress Complete was a pleasure to read, just with an
          unexpected difficulty spike.

        description="
          Following along with this book, I found it very straight forward and comprehensive.
          Everything is in simple and steps that are annotated with a description of that code's purpose.
          This book walks the reader through core fundamentals of PHP and SQL, and ends with projects such as an app that requires
          users to register or login, a forum, and an ecommerce shopping system. The book is a great introduction to building backend web-apps.
